# hello-world
Hello-world project from the github tutorial on https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Wow, github is a bit overwhelming at the start. Should be incredibly useful though, certainly beats saving my projects with a different name in the explorer. So this is not only about just learning the basics of the c# syntax but also learning about Visual Studio and github and .... and... thankfully it's fun :)
